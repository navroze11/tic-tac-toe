# tic-tac-toe
A 4*4 tic tac toe board can be solved using alpha-beta prunning which will decrease the time complexity dramatically. Although the AI is not working properly as there may be some bugs in the code.
Also the code currently written is for a 3 * 3 board. For a 4 * 4 board checkWin function needs to be updated.
